Boring brunch
=============

Boring brunch is a skeleton (boilerplate) for [Brunch](http://brunch.io).
It is based on the [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) framework.

Requires Brunch 1.4+.

## Getting started
* Create new project via executing `brunch new <project name> -s https://github.com/joakin/boring-brunch.git`.
* `cd <project name> && npm install`
* Build the project with `brunch b` or `brunch w`.
* Open the `public/` dir to see the result.
* Write your code.

## Features
* HTML5Boilerplate 4.0.0 html.
* Blank less with less prefixer included (include your fwk of preference).
* Plain old JS + LESS + Handlebars as app languages
(you can change this to anything you want)
* Backbone as main framework
* Modules for plain functional style namespaces
* Extended model, view and collection classes, so that you can extend the base
  as you may whenever you want.
* Tests with mocha and chai
* JS generators for all views, models, collections, modules, templates and
  styles.

## Missing
* Among other things, I want to add jshint support, and who knows what else
